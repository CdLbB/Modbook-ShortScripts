Modbook-ShortScripts
====================
Eventually, this repository will gather an assortment of short AppleScripts intended mainly for use on a Modbook.

QsilverQscript
--------------
An AppleScript that invokes the productivity app [Quicksilver][] and the handwriting recognition app [Axiotron Quickscript][] simultaneously, so that one can use Quickscript to conveniently enter text into a Quicksilver action. There is a standard AppleScript version that works in either Leopard or Snow Leopard and a slightly faster AppleScriptObjC version that is Snow Leopard only.
