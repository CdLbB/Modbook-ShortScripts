Modbook-ShortScripts
====================
Eventually, this repository will gather an assortment of short AppleScripts intended mainly for use on a Modbook.

Eject
-----
Since the Modbook has no eject button, two AppleScripts: One "Eject" to eject any optical media in the CD/DVD slot, and the other "EjectAll" to eject all disk volumes.

HideShowDesktop
---------------
An AppleScript that allows you to temporarily sweep all clutter off your Desktop. The Script hides all the icons on your Desktop, while still allowing you access to those items in the Finder. Run the script again and your Desktop icons reappear. Based on a script from [Mac OS X Hints][DesktopService].

LocateByName
------------
An AppleScript that searches the names of **all** files and folders for matching text. Search results are displayed in TextEdit. Then you can highlight the file you are interested in and use the context menu (control-click) to reveal the file in Finder. 

QsilverQscript
--------------
An AppleScript that invokes the productivity app [Quicksilver][] and the handwriting recognition app [Axiotron Quickscript][] simultaneously, so that one can use Quickscript to conveniently enter text into a Quicksilver action. There is a standard AppleScript version that works in either Leopard or Snow Leopard and a slightly faster AppleScriptObjC version that is Snow Leopard only.

RevealKeyboard
--------------
An AppleScript that shows the Axiotron Quickclicks Keyboard and flashes it so it can be quickly located. 

ResetTablet 
-----------
An AppleScript to reset the pen tablet driver â€” scripted to work on any Wacom-based tablet.

StartTimeMachine
----------------
Because Time Machine runs way to often, an AppleScript that starts Time Machine. So you can backup when you want to. I do mine while [Awaken][] is waking me up.

ToggleInvisibleFiles
--------------------
An AppleScript to show and hide invisible files in Finder.
